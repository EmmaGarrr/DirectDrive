OVHcloud VPS Deployment Guide for DirectDrive


This document outlines the complete process for deploying the DirectDrive full-stack application (Angular frontend and FastAPI backend) onto a fresh OVHcloud Virtual Private Server (VPS) running Ubuntu.

Project Overview:

Frontend: Angular (emmagarrr-directdrive-frontend)
Backend: Python/FastAPI with Docker (emmagarrr-directdrive)
Server: OVHcloud VPS
IP Address: 135.148.33.247
Username: ubuntu
Password:
Deployment Strategy

Backend Deployment: The FastAPI application will run inside Docker containers managed by docker-compose. This isolates its dependencies.
Frontend Deployment: The Angular application will be built into static HTML, CSS, and JS files. These files will be served by Nginx, a high-performance web server.
Firewall: A UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) will be configured to only allow necessary traffic (SSH, HTTP, and the backend API port).


Part 1: Initial Server Setup & Backend Deployment

Step 1.1: Connect to the Server
Connect to the VPS from your local machine using an SSH client (like PowerShell, Terminal, or PuTTY).
Generated bash
# Connects to the server using the 'ubuntu' username and the server's IP.
# You will be prompted for the password.
ssh ubuntu@135.148.33.247


Step 1.2: Update System and Install Core Tools
Update the server's package list and install all necessary software: git (for code), docker & docker-compose (for the backend), and nginx (for the frontend).
Generated bash
# 'sudo' is used to run commands with administrative privileges.
# 'apt update' refreshes the list of available packages.
# 'apt upgrade -y' installs all available updates without prompting.
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Installs git, docker.io, docker-compose, and nginx in a single command.
sudo apt install git docker.io docker-compose nginx -y


Step 1.3: Configure Docker Permissions
Add the ubuntu user to the docker group. This allows running docker commands without sudo, which is required by docker-compose.
Generated bash
# 'usermod -aG' adds a user to a supplementary group.
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu

# Log out for the group change to take effect.
exit

Action Required: After running exit, you must log back in using the ssh command from Step 1.1.

Step 1.4: Clone Backend Repository
Download the backend source code from GitHub onto the server.
Generated bash
# Clones the repository into a new directory named 'emmagarrr-directdrive.git'.
git clone https://github.com/emmagarrr/directdrive.git emmagarrr-directdrive.git

# Navigate into the Backend's directory.
cd emmagarrr-directdrive.git/Backend/


Step 1.5: Create Backend Environment File
The backend requires a .env file containing secret keys and configuration.
Generated bash
# 'nano' is a simple command-line text editor. This creates/opens the .env file.
nano .env

Paste the following content into the editor, filling in the real secret values:
Generated env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster-url>/
DATABASE_NAME=your_db_name
JWT_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_KEY_HERE
JWT_ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=1440
OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_google_refresh_token
GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=your_google_drive_folder_id
Use code with caution.
Env
Save and exit with Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter.

Step 1.6: Start the Backend Application
Use docker-compose to build the Docker image and start the application containers in the background.
Generated bash
# '--build' forces a rebuild of the image from the Dockerfile.
# '-d' runs the containers in detached mode (in the background).
docker-compose up --build -d


Part 2: Frontend Deployment & Nginx Configuration

Step 2.1: Configure the Firewall
Open the necessary ports for web traffic and the API.
Generated bash
# 'ufw' is the Uncomplicated Firewall.
# 'allow' creates a rule to permit traffic on a specific port/service.
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH     # Port 22 for SSH connections
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp       # Port 80 for HTTP web traffic (Nginx)
sudo ufw allow 5000/tcp     # Port 5000 for the backend API

# Enables the firewall with the new rules.
sudo ufw enable

Step 2.2: Prepare and Build the Frontend (Local Machine)
These steps are performed on your local computer.
Modify Environment: Edit the file src/environments/environment.prod.ts to point to the server's IP address.
Generated typescript
export const environment = {
  production: true,
  apiUrl: 'http://135.148.33.247:5000',
  wsUrl: 'ws://135.148.33.247:5000/ws_api'
};
Use code with caution.
TypeScript
Build the App: Run the Angular build command. This compiles the TypeScript code into a dist/ folder containing static files.
Generated bash
ng build

Step 2.3: Upload Frontend Files to Server (Local & Server)
Because the ubuntu user cannot write directly to /var/www/html, we use a two-step process.
On the Server: Create a temporary upload directory.
Generated bash
# 'mkdir' creates a new directory in the user's home folder.
mkdir ~/temp_upload

On the Local Machine: Use scp (secure copy) to upload the built files to the temporary directory on the server.
Generated bash
# '-r' copies directories recursively.
# The source is everything inside the build output folder.
# The destination is the temp_upload folder in the ubuntu user's home directory.
scp -r dist/frontend-test/* ubuntu@135.148.33.247:~/temp_upload/

On the Server: Move the files from the temporary directory to the final Nginx web root and set the correct permissions.
Generated bash
# 'sudo rm -rf' forcefully removes all existing files in the web root.
sudo rm -rf /var/www/html/*

# 'sudo mv' moves the uploaded files to the final destination.
sudo mv ~/temp_upload/* /var/www/html/

# 'chown' changes the owner of the files to the Nginx user ('www-data').
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html

# 'chmod' sets file permissions. '755' is standard for web content.
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html

# Clean up the temporary directory.
rm -rf ~/temp_upload

Step 2.4: Update Backend CORS Settings
The backend must be configured to accept requests from the server's own IP address.
On the Server, navigate back to the backend directory.
Generated bash
cd ~/emmagarrr-directdrive.git/Backend/

Edit the main application file.
Generated bash
nano app/main.py

Add the server's IP to the origins list.
Generated python
origins = [
    "http://localhost:4200",
    "https://teletransfer.vercel.app",
    "http://135.148.33.247"  # <-- ADDED LINE
]
Use code with caution.
Python
Rebuild and restart the backend to apply the changes.
Generated bash
docker-compose up --build -d

Step 2.5: Configure Nginx (Final Fix)
Edit the Nginx configuration to point to the correct sub-directory where index.html is located.
Open the Nginx configuration file.
Generated bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

Modify the root directive to point to the /browser sub-directory. The final file should look like this:
Generated nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    root /var/www/html/browser;  # <-- This was the critical change
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}
Use code with caution.
Nginx
Test the configuration and restart Nginx.
Generated bash
# 'nginx -t' tests the syntax of configuration files.
sudo nginx -t

# 'systemctl restart' restarts the Nginx service to apply changes.
sudo systemctl restart nginx


Part 3: Useful Debugging Commands

These commands were used to diagnose the "403 Forbidden" error.
Generated bash
# Check the contents and permissions of the web root folder.
ls -la /var/www/html/

# Check the permissions of the parent directories.
ls -ld /var /var/www /var/www/html

# View the last 20 lines of the Nginx error log in real-time.
sudo tail -f -n 20 /var/log/nginx/error.log

# View the logs for the backend Docker containers in real-time.
# (Must be in the 'Backend' directory)
docker-compose logs -f

# Check the status of the AppArmor security module.
sudo aa-status

# Display the content of the Nginx config file.
cat /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

At the end of this process, the application is live and accessible at http://135.148.33.247.
